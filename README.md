Go with your flo!


This is a website made for students who want to be organized and stress free.

When you open our website you will be brought to the landing page. This page has links to login and create an account. 
Something to test can be creating an account. Create an account, and then you will be brought to your profile page.

When you get to your profile page, you will see a sidebar with icons. These icons link you to all of the features of our website.

- First, there is the profile icon. This is the profile page you were just on.

- Next, there is the home icon. This brings you to your dash page. The dash page has a randomly generated photo each time you get on this page. It also has a randomly generated quote and welcome message with the user's name.

- The next icon brings you to the to do list. Here, you can add an item and check it off when you are done. This section we did not fully finish, as the items you add will not stay there, they go away when you leave this page.

- The next icon is the meditation page. This is a timer for 1 minute that allows the user to take a moment to breathe.

- Lastly is the journal page. Here a randomly generated journal promp appears for the user to write about. We wanted the entry that the user typed to be stored in their account but did not get that fully working.
